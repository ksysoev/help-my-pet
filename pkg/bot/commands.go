I'm your personal pet care assistant, ready to help you take better care of your furry friend. I can analyze photos of your pet and assist you with:

- Pet health and behavior questions - feel free to share photos of any concerning symptoms or behaviors
- Diet and nutrition advice, including photos of food or treats you're considering
- Training tips and techniques - you can send pictures of specific situations you need help with
- General pet care guidance, with photo analysis of your pet's environment or supplies

Simply type your question or send photos along with your concerns about your pet, and I'll provide helpful, informative answers based on reliable veterinary knowledge. You can send multiple photos if needed to better show the situation.

Remember, while I can offer guidance and analyze photos, for serious medical conditions, always consult with a veterinarian.

To get started, just ask me any question about your pet - with or without photos!`)
